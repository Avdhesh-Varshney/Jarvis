# Jarvis - An Offline, Multilingual Virtual Assistant

Jarvis is an advanced offline virtual assistant powered by a multilingual NLP model, speech recognition, and text-to-speech capabilities. This assistant can respond to various commands, set alarms, fetch news, provide reminders, and moreâ€”all with customizable user profiles and support for multiple languages. Perfect for privacy-sensitive, offline applications, Jarvis learns and adapts based on user interactions.
