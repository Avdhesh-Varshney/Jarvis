## Comprehensive User Guide for Jarvis
### Welcome to Jarvis! Here’s a quick guide to help you make the most out of your experience based on your role—whether you’re a User, Admin, or Super Admin.

## For Users
As a User, you can control devices, perform basic commands, and enjoy seamless voice-activated functionalities. Just say “Hey Jarvis” followed by a command, and you’re ready to go! From playing music to controlling lights, it’s designed to make daily tasks easier.

## For Admins
Admins have more control. Besides all the User capabilities, you can manage devices across different locations, monitor usage, and even set permissions for other users. Think of it as having the remote at your fingertips, but with much more reach.

## For Super Admins
As a Super Admin, you’re the top-level operator. You have access to full system settings, detailed analytics, and user management features. You’re able to adjust system-wide configurations, add or remove admins, and fine-tune Jarvis to keep everything running smoothly.
